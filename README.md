## Objectives

In descending order of significance (i.e. most important objective first):

1. **ungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web services**.
2. **ungoogled-chromium retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible**. Unlike other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser, ungoogled-chromium is essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.
3. **ungoogled-chromium features tweaks to enhance privacy, control, and transparency**. However, almost all of these features must be manually activated or enabled. For more details, see [Feature Overview](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium#feature-overview).

## Differences from ungoogled-chromium

*These are the differences between a Linux build of ungoogled-chromium and ungoogled-chromium-android.*

* Disable/Remove Android specific functionalities:
   * Contextual search
   * Home page, off by default
   * Location, falling back to the system provider
   * New Tab Page suggested sites
   * Offline indicator
   * Safe Browsing, compiled out along with its lookups
   * Terms-of-Service prompt and metrics opt-out
   * Unnecessary account permissions
* Android specific enhancements:
   * Add flag to always send `save-data` in header
   * Add flag to clear browsing data on exit
   * Add flag to disable WebRTC. This flag is enabled by default.
   * Rename the package to `org.ungoogled.chromium`, so it can be installed alongside Chrome
* Borrowed from Bromite:
   * Always incognito mode
   * Disable DRM media preprovisioning which leaks connections
   * Disable updater pings
   * DNS-over-https where the network supports it
   * Restore the flag to disable the pull-to-refresh effect
   * WebGL flag
* Borrowed from Cromite:
   * Bookmark import/export options
   * Clear open tabs between sessions
   * Exit menu item
   * Force tablet UI
   * Proxy configuration
* Borrowed from Vanadium:
   * Ask before playing protected media
   * Disable article suggestions, background sync and sensor access
   * Disable autofill server communication
   * Disable media router and media remoting
   * Disable metrics
   * Disable seed-based field trials, variations fetching and WebView variations
   * Disable showing popular sites
   * Disable the first run welcome page
   * Disable using Play services fonts
   * Enable split cache and strict site isolation
   * Various compiling time enhancements
* All Google play and Google service related blobs are removed. This includes Firebase, GCM (Google Cloud Messaging), GMS (Google Mobile Services) and bridge to Google Play.
* Releases are built for `arm` and `arm64`, plus an `.aab` for `arm64`. There is no `x86` or `x64` build.

## Limitations

The enhancements included in ungoogled-chromium **are not to be considered useful for journalists, people living in countries with freedom limitations, and those who are facing government-level adversaries**. Please look at tools specifically developed for these purposes, for example [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in such cases.

## Platforms and Versions

Pre-built apks are named as `{BUILD_TARGET}_{CPU_ARCH}.apk`, where:
* `{BUILD_TARGET}` is `ChromePublic` (previously `ChromeModernPublic` from previous maintainer wchen342), for API >= 29 (Android 10), browser only.
* `{CPU_ARCH}` is one of `arm` (armeabi-v7a), `arm64` (arm64-v8a).
* Previous maintainer also built `Trichrome`, `SystemWebView`, `x86` for releases. My builds are currently done local rather than automating through github; if there's enough people requesting further builds I can spend the time to set this up.
* The [ungoogled-chromium wiki](https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/), [Cromite documentation](https://github.com/uazo/cromite/tree/master/docs), [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium) and the [Bromite wiki](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki) can also be helpful.

## Building Instructions
*This build uses the SDK/NDK/JDK from the gclient checkout. [Android rebuilds](https://github.com/wchen342/android-rebuilds), used by earlier versions, is no longer maintained.*

* Clone this repository
* Make sure you have enough disk space and memory to build chromium
* enter repo directory and run `./build.sh`.

Dependencies can be installed automatically with `./build.sh --install-deps ...`, which runs
Chromium's own `build/install-build-deps.sh --android` once the source is fetched. It needs root
or passwordless sudo; otherwise install them by hand from the list below.

Build time dependencies (*package names as in Debian. Other distributions may have different package names*):

## Reporting and Contributing

* For reporting issues and contacting, see [SUPPORT](SUPPORT.md)
* Bug reports and code contributions are welcomed.

## Extensions

*The extension support version has been discontinued.* The last version is `88.0.4324.182`. It will still be available for downloading, but no new version will be released.

The extension patches can be found at [chromium-android-extension](https://github.com/wchen342/chromium-android-extension). Anyone interested is welcomed to fork and keeps working on it.

*Re-supporting extensions is being worked on, since many Android browsers now carry extension support.*
